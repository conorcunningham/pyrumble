# Rumble Run Client

### A simple Python client for working with the Rumble Run API

**Very much in beta beta beta**

Pyrumble is a simple API client for the [Rumble Run](https://rumble.run) API. It currently only supports operations for the `organisation/assets` endpoint, but more will be coming soon.

Please feel free to contribute if you wish, it will be much appreciated
